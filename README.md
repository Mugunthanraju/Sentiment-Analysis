## Movie Review Sentiment Analysis - Binary Classification

*This is the process of looking at data and creating a binary classification using Machine Learning to learn and predict whether the movie reviews are positive or negative*

**In this Machine Learning Project, I built binary classification that puts movie reviews texts into one of two categories â€” negative or positive sentiment. I used concepts of Bayes theorem and relax its requirements using the Naive assumption.**
